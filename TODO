Stuff to improve upon:

- [ ] Use a different vector graphic (like a chain link) instead of the X
- [ ] Make UI responsive
- [ ] Add month names next to calendar
- [ ] Lift the state up from the Day component
- [ ] Create some sort of data structure (probably hash table) to store days that were a success
- [ ] Store that data structure in local storage so it persists after refresh
- [ ] Add a backend so people can log in from anywhere.
- [ ] Add ability to start without logging in,  but dipslay warning that data might be erased if browser data cleared.
- [ ] Add import functionality from local storage to backend once user creates account. (SANITIZE DATA!!!)
- [ ] Make the amount of weeks displayed dynamic (ranging from the earliest recorded event or today up to two weeks into the future)
- [ ] Make sure the calendar is centered on today when first loading. (You should be able to scroll to see history)
- [ ] Make sure you can't mark days in the future
- [ ] Allow a "strict" mode which when enabled will only allow you to mark today's date (so you have to log in every day)
- [ ] Allow an "super strict" mode. Which is just strict mode, but once you turn it on, you can't turn it off.
- [ ] Add statistics: current streak, longest streak, date of first success, days since last success 
- [ ] Statistics will be easier to implement in super strict mode. Do that first, then everything else.
- [ ] Add possibility of exporting data.
- [ ] Add possibility of importing data?? (Make sure to sanitize input)
- [ ] Add the possibility of creating a goal (and suome sort of animation that happens when you achieve that gaol)
- [ ] Add some sort of link to explain the idea behind don't break the chain\
- [ ] Have an "accessible" toggle that changes the calendar colors to something color-blind people can differentiate
- [ ] Be able to set weekends, Sundays, or Saturdays, (or any other day) as "off" days that don't penalize your streak/score/goal when you miss them
- [ ] Have a month view, 3 month view, 6 months view, and year view in addition to the scrolling.
